## Welcome to CSV's!

## Comma Separated Files
 - An excel of data, basically.
 - We import them and manipulate the data using Ruby to get the result our bosses(or instructors!) want.

## Getting Started
 - Just like every other time!
 - Make sure to require 'csv' in your new file you make(and put in the lib folder!)
